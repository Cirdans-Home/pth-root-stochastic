# Examples

This folder contains the code used to reproduce the Examples in the paper.

- `bound.m` depiction of the bound on the eigenvalues for the associated linear systems.
- `rowstochasticexample.m` optimization on the manifold of stochastic matrices
- `rowstochasticfixedmatrixexample.m` optimization on the manifold of stochastic matrices with fixed stationary vector
- `suitesparseexample.m` contains the code for comparing the stationary 
vector of the original matrix and the one of the square root approximated
on the multinomial stochastic manifold.
